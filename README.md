# Projects at National Research Centre for Artificial intelligence

During my time at the National Research Centre for AI, I contributed to several advanced projects, including:

1. **Image Segmentation in R**  
   Worked on image segmentation tasks using R, focusing on partitioning images into meaningful segments to aid in computer vision applications.

2. **Decision Tree Implementation in Python**  
   Developed decision tree models in Python, which were used for classification tasks, optimizing model accuracy and interpretability.

3. **Algorithm Implementation in R**  
   Implemented a variety of algorithms in R, including logistic regression, ridge regression, and random forest. These implementations were key in predictive modeling and data analysis for various research studies.

In addition to these projects, I also worked on analyzing data related to autonomous vehicles, contributing to advancements in autonomous driving technology.

The associated code and documentation for these projects are included in this repository.
